## 🤓 General terms and conditions:
- The project (livesey-main-module) is non-commercial and provides for free distribution for non-commercial purposes.
- The modules (livesey-finance-library, livesey-routing, livesey-database) are licensed under the MIT license, which allows their use in commercial and non-commercial projects.
- Any contributions to the project must comply with the licensing terms and be provided under the same MIT license.

## ⚒ Technical requirements:
### Language and Framework Requirements:
- Writing a project (except for libraries or bindings) involves the use of JavaScript exclusively with limited use of TypeScript.
- TypeScript is used only to specify schemes in `d.ts` files, which are written as a supplement to the usual schemes in `.js`.
- The project is written in a framework-agnostic format, without using popular frameworks (express, fastify).

### Coding Standards and Patterns:
- All modules are written in accordance with the principles and patterns announced in the GoF in compliance with SOLID approaches.
- SQL queries are formed only through parameterized functions, which are abstract wrappers of queries from livesey-database.

### Validation and Security:
- Validation for `.env` is supposed to be used with the help of `dotenv` (loading variables), `zod`, `t3-oss` (validation) modules.
- All data received from outside the module must be validated for compliance with the specified scheme and types.

### Testing:
- Unit testing is required to test the system.
- Test results should be reviewed as part of the code review process.

## 👩‍💻 The procedure for making changes:
### Branching and Commits:
- When adding changes, you need to create a branch separate from the selected one.
- Use meaningful commit messages that clearly describe the purpose of the changes.
- Follow a consistent branching strategy, such as GitFlow or feature branching.

### Pull Requests and Code Review:
- After the commit of changes, a pull request is created, in which you need to specify in detail what changes have been implemented, and you also need to specify the person who must approve the commit.
- At least one other team member must review the pull request before it can be merged.
- Code reviews should focus on code quality, adherence to standards, and potential bugs.
- After approval, the branch should be merged into the main branch with a "squash and merge" strategy to keep the commit history clean.

### Testing Requirements:
- Ensure that all tests pass before submitting a pull request.
- New features or bug fixes should include corresponding unit or integration tests.

> **P.S.:** When writing any changes to the system, you also need to write unit tests for it and put them in the `/tests` folder.

## 🪄 Code stylistics:
### Linting and Formatting:
- When writing code, you must use a single ESLint configuration. See more: [eslint](https://github.com/livesey-finance/livesey-how-to/blob/main/eslint.md).
- Consistent use of Prettier for code formatting is recommended.

### Documentation:
- For each module, release, etc., you need to write documentation in the `.md` format. See more: [documentation](https://github.com/livesey-finance/livesey-how-to/blob/main/documentation.md).
- Documentation should include an overview, installation instructions, API references, and examples.
- Ensure that all public APIs are documented, including parameters, return values, and potential errors.

## 📆 Version Control and Release Management:
### Versioning:
- Follow semantic versioning (SemVer) for releases: `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`.
- Document changes in a `CHANGELOG.md` file for each release.

### Release Process:
- Releases should be created only after thorough testing and code review.
- Tag releases in the version control system (e.g., Git) with the version number.
- Ensure that the main branch is always in a deployable state.

## 👮‍♀️ Security and Compliance:
### Security Practices:
- Regularly update dependencies to address security vulnerabilities.
- Conduct security audits of the codebase periodically.

### Compliance:
- Ensure compliance with relevant laws and regulations, particularly concerning data protection and privacy.
