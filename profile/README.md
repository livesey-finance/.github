## Livesey is an open-source, non-profit, infrastructure solution designed to work with financial data. 
### The main parts of the Livesey infrastructure are:
* [`🌱Livesey`](https://github.com/livesey-finance/livesey-main-module.git) - an application that helps investors, traders, and others interested in working with stocks and cryptocurrencies by analyzing ratios calculated based on the company's main financial characteristics
* [`🧪livesey-finance-library`](https://github.com/livesey-finance/livsey-finance-library.git) - a library that provides formulas for accurate calculation of data for further analysis
* [`🌶️livesey-data-parser`](https://github.com/livesey-finance/livesey-data-parser.git) - a module that allows you to collect data to create applications that should work with the financial API(temporary private)
* [`🔧livesey-routing`](https://github.com/livesey-finance/livesey-routing.git) - a lightweight HTTP router that facilitates handling requests and responses in a Node.js application
* [`🛠️livesey-database`](https://github.com/livesey-finance/livesey-database.git) - a lightweight module that allows you to work with database queries without using ORM
